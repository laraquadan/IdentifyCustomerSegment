# IdentifyCustomerSegment
In this project, a real-life data provided to us by Udacity Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. Unsupervised learning techniques are used to organize the general population into clusters, then those clusters are used to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, the data was assested and cleaned in order to convert the data into a usable form.
Note that the dataset file is not provided as part of this repository since it is protected under copy right.
